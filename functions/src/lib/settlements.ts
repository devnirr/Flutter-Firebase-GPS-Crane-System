 * The weekly corte: what the company and a chofer owe each other.
 *
 * A chofer keeps the money from a cash job and owes the company its
 * commission. On an insurer's tow nobody paid the chofer, so the company owes
 * them their share. Once a week the two are netted:
 *
 *     balance = (what Titan owes for insurer jobs) − (commission owed on cash jobs)
 *
 * Positive, the company transfers the balance to the chofer on Friday.
 * Negative, the chofer transfers or deposits it to the company.
 *
 * Built from the chofer's earnings entries, each counted in exactly one corte:
 * the entries a corte takes are marked with its id in the same transaction
 * that writes it. Nothing here touches Firestore.
